        6th of July, '25:
        Updated the spriteSet button. previously, when you loaded more pokemon and clicked setSprite, the loaded pokemon
        would be hidden and only the first 12 cards would show. fixed this issue - now when you load many pokemon and
        click the sprite option, it will not reset and will continue showing all loaded Pokemon.
    </p>

    <p>
        5th of July, '25: updated the data fetching method. replaced the direct fetch/display logic with the
        displayPokemons() function. created new arrays: all data is now stored in the allPokeData array at once,
        then stored in the pokemonsToShow array for display. also reorganized event listeners and loader logic for
        asynchronous display and improved UI responsiveness. removed some legacy functions.
    </p>
